#### 2.1 **Types of Research: Primary vs. Secondary**

Market research typically involves two types of research: **Primary Research** and **Secondary Research**.

**a. Primary Research**
Primary research is the process of gathering original data directly from the source, often involving customers or potential customers. Examples of primary research include:

* **Interviews** (telephone or face-to-face)
* **Surveys** (online or via mail)
* **Questionnaires** (online or via mail)
* **Focus Groups**
* **Competitor Location Visits**

Primary research can be categorized into:

1. **Exploratory Research**: General, open-ended research aimed at understanding broader issues (e.g., long interviews).
2. **Specific Research**: More precise, used to address issues identified in exploratory research (e.g., structured, formal interviews).

While **primary research** can be time-consuming and costly, it provides conclusive and specific results.

**b. Secondary Research**
Secondary research involves analyzing pre-existing data that has already been compiled and published by others. Examples include:

* Government reports
* Trade association studies
* Industry publications
* Research from other businesses

Secondary research is typically more affordable and quicker to obtain than primary research, making it an attractive option for businesses with limited resources. Much of this research is available on the internet, through sources like government websites or industry journals. However, it's important to check the publication date to ensure the data is current.
