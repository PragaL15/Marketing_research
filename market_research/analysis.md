---

### **6. Chi-Square Test**

**Purpose:**
To examine relationships between categorical variables.

**Output:**
Determines whether observed frequencies differ significantly from expected frequencies.

**Application:**

* Analyzing whether customer preferences are independent of gender.
* Testing associations between product category and purchase location.

---

### **7. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Purpose:**
To uncover patterns, anomalies, or hypotheses within data.

**Techniques:**

* Data visualization (scatter plots, heatmaps).
* Identifying outliers and missing values.

**Application:**

* Visualizing customer segmentation data.
* Identifying trends in time-series sales data.

---

### **8. Qualitative Analysis Techniques**

**Purpose:**
To analyze non-numerical data like opinions, feedback, or interviews.

**Methods:**

* **Thematic Analysis:** Identifying recurring themes.
* **Content Analysis:** Categorizing textual data.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Measuring opinions or attitudes.

**Application:**

* Analyzing customer reviews to identify pain points.
* Understanding motivations for choosing eco-friendly products.

---

### **9. Multivariate Analysis**

**Purpose:**
To analyze more than two variables simultaneously.

**Techniques:**

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A technique for reducing the dimensionality of large datasets.
* **Cluster Analysis:** Grouping similar observations based on characteristics.
* **Factor Analysis:** Identifying underlying relationships between variables.

**Application:**

* Identifying customer segments based on multiple characteristics.
* Reducing dimensions in large datasets for better visualization.

---

### **10. Time Series Analysis**

**Purpose:**
To analyze data points collected over time to identify trends, seasonal patterns, or cyclic behavior.

**Techniques:**

* **Moving Averages:** A method for smoothing data points to observe trends.
* **ARIMA Models (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average):** A forecasting method for time-series data.

**Application:**

* Forecasting monthly sales.
* Understanding seasonality in customer demand.

## Advance Analysis

---

### **1. Cluster Analysis**

**Purpose:**
To segment customers into distinct groups based on similarities in their characteristics or behaviors.

**Technique:**

* Divides data into clusters using algorithms like:

  * **K-means**: A method to partition data into K clusters.
  * **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree-like structure to group data.
  * **DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering algorithm that finds clusters based on the density of data points.
* Customers within a cluster are similar to each other but different from those in other clusters.

**Application:**

* Segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior.
* Identifying demographic groups for targeted marketing.

---

### **2. Factor Analysis**

**Purpose:**
To reduce the number of variables in a dataset by identifying underlying factors.

**Technique:**

* Analyzes the interrelations among variables and groups them into factors that explain the variance in the data.

**Application:**

* Identifying key factors influencing customer preferences.
* Simplifying complex datasets for segmentation.
