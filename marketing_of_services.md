#### 💼 **1. Marketing of Services**

* Marketing services means promoting intangible offerings that provide **value through experiences, expertise, and interaction**.
* **Why it matters?** The world is now a *service-driven economy* 🌍. Most developed and developing countries have shifted from:

* Services and goods are now interconnected – forming a **goods-services continuum**.
* **Definition by AMA (1960):**

  > “Activities, benefits and satisfactions offered for sale or with the sale of goods.”
* **Definition by Quinn et al. (1987):**

  > Services are economic activities with intangible output, consumed as produced, offering value like convenience or health.
